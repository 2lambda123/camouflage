# Future plans

Following items are on current todo list:

1. Add a proxy server which could then be used to implement a recording option to create mocks.
2. Proxy server can also be used to make calls to actual downstream application if required.

If you'd like to contribute, you could either pick up an item from current todos, or submit your suggestions [here](https://forms.gle/TNJnr2WWvYkqYNHH9){target=\_blank}.

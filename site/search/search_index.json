Selector will change accordingly. num_between Type: Custom Helper Usage: {{num_between lower=500 upper=600}} : Generate a number between two values.

Creation of mocks remains similar to HTTP mocks with some minor changes. For starters, gRPC mocks should not be placed in the same mocks directory as HTTP mocks, instead they should have their own mocks and protos directories. Secondly, the folder structure inside grpc mocks directory will follow the convention ./grpc/mocks/ package_name / service_name / method_name .mock Creating a gRPC Mock - Unary Or Client Side Streaming To create a new grpc mock, you would need the .proto file for your gRPC service. ex. todo.proto Create two new directories ./grpc/mocks and ./grpc/protos (you can name them as you wish) Place your .proto file in ./grpc/protos directory. Now, all we need is a .mock file. But, creating folder structure for gRPC follows a slightly different approach compared to HTTP mocks, and could be little complicated if you are not aware of Protofile syntanx. In any case, you would need following steps. Start by looking for a package name in your .proto file. Next you'd need the service name, and finally the method you need to mock. Create a new folder in ./grpc/mocks directory with the package name. e.g. ./grpc/mocks/todoPackage Create another folder in ./grpc/mocks/todoPackage directory with the service name. e.g. ./grpc/mocks/todoPackage/TodoService Finally create a .mock file in the directory ./grpc/mocks/todoPackage/TodoService with the method name. e.g ./grpc/mocks/todoPackage/TodoService/createTodo.mock Place your expected response in the mock file and you are done. You can use the handlebars as usual in your response!! { \"id\": \"{{randomValue type='UUID'}}\", \"text\": \"{{randomValue type='ALPHABETIC' length='100'}}\" } Creating a gRPC Mock - Server Side Streaming In case you are creating a service with server side streaming, you can place a seperator between each chunk of responses in following manner: { \"id\": \"{{randomValue type='UUID'}}\", \"text\": \"{{randomValue type='ALPHABETIC' length='100'}}\" } ==== { \"id\": \"{{randomValue type='UUID'}}\", \"text\": \"{{randomValue type='ALPHABETIC' length='100'}}\" } ==== { \"id\": \"{{randomValue type='UUID'}}\", \"text\": \"{{randomValue type='ALPHABETIC' length='100'}}\" } Note The seperator Camouflage understands is '====', i.e. 4 equals. Creating a gRPC Mock - Bidi Streaming If you are creating a bidirectional streaming mock, your mock file would contain two different types of data. One, what to send when client is streaming, defined by the key \"data\". Two, an optional key \"end\", in case you want server to send something when client ends the connection. If your requirement is to simply end the stream when client ends the stream, without sending any additional data, you can simply omit the \"end\" key from your mockfile. { \"data\": { \"id\": \"{{randomValue type='UUID'}}\", \"text\": \"{{randomValue type='ALPHABETIC' length='100'}}\" }, \"end\": { \"id\": \"{{randomValue type='UUID'}}\", \"text\": \"{{randomValue type='ALPHABETIC' length='100'}}\" } } Adding delays in gRPC You can also add delays in your grpc mock services, by adding a delay key with the value in your mock file. { \"id\": \"{{randomValue type='UUID'}}\", \"text\": \"{{randomValue type='ALPHABETIC' length='100'}}\", \"delay\": {{num_between lower=500 upper=600}} } You don't need to modify your proto file to accomodate the additional key, since Camouflage will delete the \"delay\" key from the response before sending it to the client. Caution Since Camouflage gRPC server needs to register the new services everytime you create new mock, you'd need to restart the Camouflage server. Good news is, you can do so easily by making a get request to /restart endpoint. Though the downtime is minimal (less than a second, we do not recommend restarting the server during a performance test.","title":"Mocking gRPC"},{"location":"mocking-gRPC/#mocking-grpc","text":"Camouflage introduces mocking gRPC services. Creation of mocks remains similar to HTTP mocks with some minor changes. For starters, gRPC mocks should not be placed in the same mocks directory as HTTP mocks, instead they should have their own mocks and protos directories.

To do so you can utilize the power of handlebars again. Simply provide an if else condition and you are good to go. Consider following example.
